<h1>Bird's-eye view of a PuzzleScript file</h1>
<p>
A puzzlescript file is divided into 8 sections:
<p>

  <ul class="nav nav-pills">
    <li><a href="prelude.html">Prelude</a></li>
    <li><a href="objects.html">Objects</a></li>
    <li><a href="legend.html">Legend</a></li>
    <li><a href="sounds.html">Sounds</a></li>
    <li><a href="collisionlayers.html">CollisionLayers</a></li>
    <li><a href="rules.html">Rules</a></li>
    <li class="active"><a href="winconditions.html">WinConditions</a></li>
    <li><a href="levels.html">Levels</a></li>
  </ul>




    <p>
    <h2>WinConditions</h2>
    <p>
    Here are the possible formats of win conditions:
    <p>
    <pre><code> (neko puzzle - you win if there's no fruit left)
No Fruit

(sokoban - you win if every target point has a crate on it)
All Target On Crate 

(you win if Love exists somewhere)
Some Love 

(you win if there's some gold in the chest)
Some gold on chest 

(you win if all gold has been taken from the chest)
No gold on chest</code></pre>
<p>
  If you have multiple win conditions, they normally all have to be satisfied.
  This is the default, and usually will work fine for your games. However,
  sometimes you might find it useful to have multiple ways a player can finish a level.
  Typically, this happens because you have multiple types of levels
  with different win conditions.
  <p>
    For instance, you might want "overworld"
  levels, where you "win" an overworld level by moving
  to one of the exits (rather than by solving a puzzle). You might
  also just want a couple variants on the same idea; for instance, in a relatively
  traditional sokoban game, you might be ok with players having the choice
  to either cover all the targets
    with crates or making it to the exit.
    <p>
  To implement this, you'll want <it>win types</it>. Here's what that looks like:
    <p>
      <pre><code>
(Section Neko)
(neko puzzle - you win if there's no fruit left)
No Fruit

Section Sokoban
(sokoban - you win if every target point has a crate on it)
All Target On Crate 

Section Love
(you win if Love exists somewhere)
Some Love 

Section FillChest
(you win if there's some gold in the chest)
Some gold on ChestToFill

Section EmptyChest
(you win if all gold has been taken from the chest)
No gold on ChestToEmpty</code></pre>
    <p>
  If you put this code into your game, you would be able to win in a whopping
  five ways. You would win immediately if there's no fruit, or if every target
  is covered by a crate, and so on.
    <p>
  As you can see, the only thing you need to do is separate each possible win type
  by the keyword 'Section'. Each win type should have a unique name;
  when you win a level, this name will be printed in the console for easier debugging.
  The very first win type (before any 'Section' keyword) is the 'default' win type,
  and does not get a name so that games not using this feature shouldn't notice any changes.
   <p>
  For technical reasons, win types cannot have a space in their name.
   <p>
  As with the simple case where there is only the default win type, you can put multiple
  win conditions in a single win type; all of them must be satisfied in order
  for the player to win in that way.
   <p>
  If the player satisfies the conditions of multiple win types at once, the engine will prefer whichever appears first when deciding which type of win to award the player.
   <p>
  These should do for most games, but if you want more advanced control over winning and losing, then you can specify your own win rules using <a href="rules.html#commands">commands</a>.

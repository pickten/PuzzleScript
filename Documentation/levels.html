<h1>Bird's-eye view of a PuzzleScript file</h1>
<p>
A puzzlescript file is divided into 8 sections:
<p>

  <ul class="nav nav-pills">
    <li><a href="prelude.html">Prelude</a></li>
    <li><a href="objects.html">Objects</a></li>
    <li><a href="legend.html">Legend</a></li>
    <li><a href="sounds.html">Sounds</a></li>
    <li><a href="collisionlayers.html">CollisionLayers</a></li>
    <li><a href="rules.html">Rules</a></li>
    <li><a href="winconditions.html">WinConditions</a></li>
    <li class="active"><a href="levels.html">Levels</a></li>
  </ul>



  <p>
    <h2>Levels</h2>
    <p>
    Here's where all the fun happens.  A level section of a file looks something like this:
    <p>
    <pre><code>
#########
#.......#
#.*.*.O.#
#..*..O.#
#.P.*.*.#
#.......#
#########

MESSAGE Woah, that was tough, eh?!


#########
#.....@.#
#.P.*.O.#
#.......#
#########


#########
#.....@.#
#.P.*.O.#     
#.......#
#########

MESSAGE Thank you for playing the game.</code></pre>
<p>
Levels are separated by blank lines, and you can also display messages if you want to.  If you want to have several objects occupying  single tile, you can specify this in the <a href="legend.html">legend</a> using <b>and</b>:
<p>
<pre><code>@ = Crate and Target
</code></pre>
<p>
If you hold CTRL (or, on a Mac, CMD) and left click on the level in the text editor, it will load it in game.
<p>
<h3>Branching</h3>
<p>
  If you want a continuous open world you can set <b>zoomscreen</b> or <b>flickscreen</b> in the <a href="prelude.html">prelude</a>. If you want a real open world, however,
  you'll probably want <it>level scripting</it>.
  <h4>Warning: this feature is currently a bit underdeveloped</h4>
  <p>
  It also is not very in-keeping with the rest of PuzzleScript; as such I would caution you
  not to use it unless you really have a specific idea for it, and to keep in mind
  that I may change my mind about it at some point. That said, I made it because
  I needed it and so I won't remove it until I have an alternative system in place for all this.
<p>
  Level scripting looks very similar to the MESSAGE keyword above.
  However, unlike the MESSAGE keyword, level scripting features
  can affect long-term player state that spans beyond a single level.
  Here are all the available commands:
<p>
  <dl>
    <dt>section</dt>
  <dd>
  If you use the <b>section</b> keyword in the LEVELS section, as in 'section tutorial',
  that teaches PuzzleScript
  that the tutorial begins there.
  It might be just one level, or it might go on for much longer.
  In general, level scripting features tend to make minimal assumptions about how your
  sections are laid out, and
  even weird stuff like overlapping sections should not cause any problems.
  </dd>
  <dt>goto</dt>
  <dd>When the engine reaches this level, it will magically try to skip to whatever section or level is indicated. This is pretty free-form, and supports two base versions plus a few special features.
    <p>
    The simplest way to use <b>goto</b> is to just write the name of a section that you wannt to jump to.
    <p>
    While very much not recommended, you can also write the number of a level. This gets really finnicky and is generally kind of unmanageable. But if for whatever reason you want to do it, be my guest.
    <p>
      If you want more advanced features, you can get them. The most useful one is for multi-level sections: if you run 'goto tutorial 5', PuzzleScript will go to the fifth level in the tutorial section. It tries to be smart about what this means, but it's a work in progress. Still, hopefully this will reduce the number of <b>section</b> commands you need.
    <p>
      If that fails, you can also use <a href="levelscripting.html">level scripting code</a> to generate the destination level at run time with something like 'goto [nextlevel]'. This can be combined with all the other ways to use 'goto'; for instance, in this silly example, if '[nextlevel]' evaluates to 'tutorial', the 'tutorial' section will get loaded.
  </dd>
  <dt>begincond</dt>
  <dd>begins a conditional.
    This command accepts one or more values, which can be (and usually are) generated at runtime via <a href="levelscripting.html">level scripting</a>. The values are placed onto the <it>condnitional stack</it> as a group (in the same order as you list them). Conditionals behave similarly to the 'switch' statement of a conventional programming language.
    <p>
      Note that the conditional stack is very delicate; as such, any kind of <b>goto</b> will clear the conditional stack (which can be useful for branching levels). Conversely, using <b>goto</b> to jump into the middle of a conditional will cause serious problems.
  </dd>
  <dt>endcond</dt>
  <dd>ends a conditional. This just removes the last group of values added onto the conditional stack. Each conditional must begin with a <b>begincond</b> and end with an <b>endcond</b>; if they are mismatched, PuzzleScript will throw an error.</dd>
  <dt>contcond</dt>
  <dd>starts a conditional branch. This command accepts one or more values, which can be (and usually are) generated at runtime via <a href="levelscripting.html">level scripting</a>. If you input N values, PuzzleScript will check the last N values on the conditional stack and compare them. If all N values match, the conditional branch executes; if not, PuzzleScript will jump to the next branch of the same conditional (i.e. the next <b>contcond</b>, <b>elsecond</b>, or <b>endcond</b> in the same conditional). </dd>
  <dt>elsecond</dt>
  <dd>starts a conditional branch. This works identically to 'contcond' except that the branch is also skipped if another branch of the same conditional was taken.</dd>
  <dt>savegame</dt>
  <dd>saves the game. Only relevant if 'noautosave' is enabled; otherwise, the game will save after every level.</dd>
  <dt>evaluate</dt>
  <dd>evaluates one or more <a href="levelscripting.html">level scripting</a> blocks.</dd>
